# 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition System

A professional-grade Streamlit application for real-time, batch, and educational recognition of traffic signs using Deep Learning.  
Built with modern UI, features interactive visualizations, and supports both single and batch image analysis, as well as webcam-based detection.

---

## 📜 Project Overview

The **Traffic Sign Recognition System** is a deep learning project focused on classifying German traffic signs from images. It leverages a custom-trained CNN model, built and deployed with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), and offers an intuitive UI for users to interact, test, and learn about traffic signs.

## 📝 Description

- **Dataset Used:** [GTSRB (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)
- **Goal:** Classify traffic signs based on their image using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation
- **Model:** Custom CNN trained to recognize multiple traffic sign classes
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy, confusion matrix, and top-k prediction confidences
